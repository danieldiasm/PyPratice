This repo is a type of notebook of Python 3.X scripts.

There are things whicht are way VERY simple and basic, but also nice stuff and neat tricks.

I did this because sometimes I have to keep looking on my scripts to find something nice I did and want to use or remember or test something. Having a place to put it all is very nice.

Can also be valuable to other people, so, feel free to use it, copy, paste, study, check my notes, suggest changes...

This is an evergrowing repo. I've started it on 02nd September 2019, and commited some stuff laying around on a flash drive and also wrote some scripts to put in here, commented and explained as best ad possible at the given momment.

If you find some explanation, not clear, some error on my comments, feel free to get in touch and tell me about it! I'll be glad to know and fix it.

That is it!

P.S. I also wanted to create something useful for the community, I hope it help someone, someway, someday. This is some of my first steps on creating a long lasting contribution.
